# RaspberryPiRadio
Code to make a raspberry pi into a single station radio
This is designed to work on a raspberry pi with wireless access
It plays a single radio station at start up.
It may be extended with a rotary selector to play multiple stations.
This uses an Adafruit I2S 3W Stereo Speaker Bonnet for Raspberry Pi to get the stero sound and an additonal HAT on top of that to host the LEDs, the switch and the MCP3008 ADC chip which allowes the Pi to read a potentiometer.
